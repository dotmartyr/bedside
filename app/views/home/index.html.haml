          Helping someone through a hospital stay is hard work, and it can be difficult to
          keep everyone in the know. Bedside makes it easy to publish updates to everyone in
          the group.
        %p.p-5
          Bedside also gives people a spot to leave messages and love when they aren't able
          to visit.

          Bedside lets you create a simple wishlist so that people know what to bring when
          they come to visit. That way you can suggest favorite boredom breakers or special
          treats from home, and everyone can chip in to help make the stay a bit more comfortable.

          Every hospital has a few quirks to learn. Share tips for visitors about where to
          park, how to get to the room, or even good topics to chat about.
